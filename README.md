The reference that I used while creating this app can be found [here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/110401633/Nintendo-Shop?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7Cmobile%20application%20ui%20design) and I highly recommand anyone interested in Flutter to start by reproducing existing concepts as it helps learning widgets, methods and so on.
